# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Books can be moved from one shelf to another and new books can be added through a Search page.

## Dependencies
[React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
[Prop Types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)
[lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)

## Setup

Steps need to run the project:
1. Clone or download the source
2. Install all project dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```
$ npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
